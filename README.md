<img src="images/icon.png" alt="LiveView-icon" width="256"/>

This repository contains the re-designed, open source release of LiveView, an imaging spectrometer data visualisation program. This version improves on previous versions of LiveView by integrating all functionality into a single program, reducing the complexity of installing the software. Hardware acceleration is implemented in OpenCL instead of CUDA, and provides a greater degree of hardware compatibility compared to the prior NVIDIA-only implementation. This version also provides several new camera interfaces to provide compatibility with more types of hardware.

LiveView is compatible with MacOS and Linux. Compatibility with specific distributions of Linux may vary, but Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat 6/7 have been tested. Addtionally, a process for building LiveView for embedded Yocto Linux systems is actively being developed.
